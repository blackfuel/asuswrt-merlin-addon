.SH DESCRIPTION
lvremove removes one or more logical volumes.
Confirmation will be requested before deactivating any active logical
volume prior to removal.  Logical volumes cannot be deactivated
or removed while they are open (e.g. if they contain a mounted filesystem).
Removing an origin logical volume will also remove all dependent snapshots.
.sp
If the logical volume is clustered then it must be deactivated on all
nodes in the cluster before it can be removed. A single lvchange command
issued from one node can do this.
.sp
If the configuration setting \fBmetadata/record_lvs_history\fP is enabled 
and the logical volume being removed forms part of the history of at least
one logical volume that is still present then a simplified representation of
the logical volume will be retained.  This includes the time of removal
(\fBlv_time_removed\fP reporting field), creation time (\fBlv_time\fP), name
(\fBlv_name\fP), LV uuid (\fBlv_uuid\fP) and VG name (\fBvg_name\fP) and
allows you to see the ancestry chain of thin snapshot volumes even after
some intermediate logical volumes have been removed.
The names of such historical logical volumes acquire a hyphen as a prefix
(e.g. '-lvol1') and cannot be reactivated.  Use lvremove a second time,
with the hyphen, to remove the record of the former logical volume completely.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP(8) for common options.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
Remove active logical volumes without confirmation.
Tool will try to deactivate \fIunused\fP volume.
To proceed with damaged pools use \-ff
.TP
.B \-\-nohistory
Disable the recording of history of logical volumes which are being removed.
(This has no effect unless the configuration setting
\fBmetadata/record_lvs_history\fP is enabled.)
.TP
.B \-\-noudevsync
Disable udev synchronisation. The
process will not wait for notification from udev.
It will continue irrespective of any possible udev processing
in the background.  You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.
.SH Examples
Remove the active logical volume lvol1 in volume group vg00
without asking for confirmation:
.sp
.B lvremove \-f vg00/lvol1
.sp
Remove all logical volumes in volume group vg00:
.sp
.B lvremove vg00
