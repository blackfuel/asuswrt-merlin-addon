.SH DESCRIPTION
vgcfgbackup allows you to backup the metadata of your volume groups.
If you don't name any volume groups on the command line, all of them
will be backed up.
.sp
In a default installation, each volume group gets backed up into a separate
file bearing the name of the volume group in the directory
\fI/home/evaluation/asuswrt-merlin-addon/asuswrt/etc/lvm/backup\fP.
You can write the backup to an alternative file using \fB\-f\fP.  In this case
if you are backing up more than one volume group the filename is
treated as a template, and %s gets replaced by the volume group name.
.sp
NB. This DOESN'T backup user/system data in logical
volume(s)!  Backup \fI/home/evaluation/asuswrt-merlin-addon/asuswrt/etc/lvm\fP regularly too.
