.SH DESCRIPTION
vgscan scans all SCSI, (E)IDE disks, multiple devices and a bunch
of other disk devices in the system looking for LVM physical volumes
and volume groups.  Define a filter in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) to restrict 
the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.
.LP
In LVM2, vgscans take place automatically; but you might still need to
run one explicitly after changing hardware.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP(8) for common options.
.TP
.B \-\-mknodes
Also checks the LVM special files in /dev that are needed for active 
logical volumes and creates any missing ones and removes unused ones.
.TP
.B \-\-notifydbus
Send a notification to D-Bus. The command will exit with an error
if LVM is not built with support for D-Bus notification, or if the
notify_dbus config setting is disabled.
.TP
.B \-\-cache
Scan devices for LVM physical volumes and volume groups and instruct
the lvmetad daemon to update its cached state accordingly.
